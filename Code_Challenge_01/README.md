# My-Profile
Hello there! I'm Lucy Kamau, a graduate student at URI majoring in Civil and Environmental Engineering.
## About Me
I was born and raised in Nairobi, Kenya, a country known for it's long distance athletes. Well, myself I cannot run ~~whispers~~.

My second name is interesting, **Nyambura** which means born during `rgb(rain)` .

I love reading, travelling, hiking and trying different cuisines and on my free time I'm watching soccer a great fan of Manchester United, basketball or scrolling through social media. I recently joined Tiktok and _i waste my time there_.

## Feeding Giraffes
One of the most amazing thing i recommend people to do when they visit Kenya, feeding the giraffes.
